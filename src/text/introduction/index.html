1. This is a course in miracles. 
²It is a required course. 
³Only the time you take it is voluntary. 
⁴Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. 
⁵It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. 
⁶The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. 
⁷It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. 
⁸The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.</em>

This is a course in miracles. The course is required. Only the time you take the course is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. Free will means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love. The meaning of love is beyond what the course can teach. The course aims at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence. Love is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear. But what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.

Love encompasses all, but the course can’t teach love. Instead we teach you to remove the fear that blocks your awareness of love. You must learn this course, but you are free to choose when to learn it.

  2. This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</em>
  <span class=quote style=font-weight:bold>
    ²Nothing real can be threatened. <br> 
    ³Nothing unreal exists.
  </span>
  ⁴Herein lies the peace of God.

This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:

  So in summary: There is no threat to what is real. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God. 
</details>

<details><summary>Simplified</summary>
  <p>
    There is no threat to something that doesn't change. And anything that can change doesn’t exist. True peace is knowing this.
  </p>
  <p>OR</p> 
  <p>There is no threat to necesary existence. Contingent existence is imaginary. [Using philosophical definitions of real: 1) that which never changes or 2) necessary, as opposed to contingent, existence. —Ed.)</p>
