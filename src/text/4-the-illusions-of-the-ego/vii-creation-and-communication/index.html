²Ego illusions are quite specific, although the mind is naturally abstract.

⁴The concrete part believes in the ego, because the ego depends on the concrete.

2. Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply being. 
²The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilised to establish separateness rather than to abolish it. 
³The communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it dictates. 
⁴Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat. 
⁵This disruption is a reaction to a specific person or persons. 
⁶The specificity of the ego’s thinking, then, results in spurious generalisation which is really not abstract at all. 
⁷It merely responds in certain specific ways to everything it perceives as related.

The ego perceives everything as separate. 
The ego only uses communication to establish separation. 
When the ego feels threatened, it will disrupt relationships and true communication. 
Specific people or situations threaten the ego. 
The threat is then generalised to everything the ego perceives.

3. In contrast, spirit reacts in the same way to everything it knows is true, and does not respond at all to anything else. 
²Nor does it make any attempt to establish what is true. 
³It knows that what is true is everything that God created. 
⁴It is in complete and direct communication with every aspect of creation, because it is in complete and direct communication with its Creator. 
⁵This communication is the Will of God. 
⁶Creation and communication are synonymous. 
⁷God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will. 
⁸Since only beings of a like order can truly communicate, His creations naturally communicate with Him and like Him. 
⁹This communication is perfectly abstract, since its quality is universal in application and not subject to any judgment, any exception or any alteration. 
¹⁰God created you by this and for this. 
¹¹The mind can distort its function, but it cannot endow itself with functions it was not given. 
¹²That is why the mind cannot totally lose the ability to communicate, even though it may refuse to utilise it on behalf of being.

4. Existence as well as being rests on communication. 
²Existence, however, is specific in how, what and with whom communication is judged to be worth undertaking. 
³Being is completely without these distinctions. 
⁴It is a state in which the mind is in communication with everything that is real. 
⁵To whatever extent you permit this state to be curtailed you are limiting your sense of your own reality, which becomes total only by recognizing all reality in the glorious context of its real relationship to you. 
⁶This is your reality. 
⁷Do not desecrate it or recoil from it. 
⁸It is your real home, your real temple and your real Self.
