<summary>Summary</summary>
There is no order of difficulty in miracles. 
There is one problem and one solution. 
The problem is the identification with the separate ego–body. 
The solution is the realization of my Oneness with God and Christ. 
As the Son of God I have the power to choose the Holy Spirit or the ego and to believe in what I make. 
All power over the dream world is in my mind as the decision maker — the Son of God. (Wingate)
