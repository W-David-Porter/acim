  1. Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard for them to reach your own awareness.
  ²The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major perceptual distortion.
  ³Physical impulses are misdirected miracle impulses.
  ⁴All real pleasure comes from doing God’s Will.
  ⁵This is because <em>not</em> doing it is a denial of Self.
  ⁶Denial of Self results in illusions, while correction of the error brings release from it.
  ⁷Do not deceive yourself into believing that you can relate in peace to God or to your brothers with anything external.

    (4) By using the world as a substitute for the role God alone would have in our lives, our belief in the spearation from God is reinforced, and it is this that gave rise to the world of suffering and pain in the first place. (Wapnick, FAJ, p.17.)
  </p>

  <p>
    (4–5) If we truly looked at anything in this world, we would realize that what we thought had given us happiness and joy was really filled with pain. (Wapnick, AVI, p.265.)

    (4–5) This discussion is not meant to imply that one should feel guilt over sexual thoughts, feelings, or behavior, any more than one should feel guilt for needing oxygen or food to survive. But it is helpful to recognize the dynamics of sexuality so as to understand better the dynamics of guilt, which <em>is</em> the problem.

  2. Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy.
  ²Do not forget this.
  ³The Love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed through one body to another, because vision is still so dim.
  ⁴You can use your body best to help you enlarge your perception so you can achieve real vision, of which the physical eye is incapable.
  ⁵Learning to do this is the body’s only true usefulness.

  3. Fantasy is a distorted form of vision.
  ²Fantasies of any kind are distortions, because they always involve twisting perception into unreality.
  ³Actions that stem from distortions are literally the reactions of those who know not what they do.
  ⁴Fantasy is an attempt to control reality according to false needs.
  ⁵Twist reality in any way and you are perceiving destructively.
  ⁶Fantasies are a means of making false associations and attempting to obtain pleasure from them.
  ⁷But although you can perceive false associations, you can never make them real except to yourself.
  ⁸You believe in what you make.
  ⁹If you offer miracles, you will be equally strong in your belief in them.
  ¹⁰The strength of your conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver.
  ¹¹Fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent to both giver and receiver.
  ¹²Reality is “lost” through usurpation, which produces tyranny.
  ¹³As long as a single “slave” remains to walk the earth, your release is not complete.
  ¹⁴Complete restoration of the Sonship is the only goal of the miracle-minded.

(7–8) Within the illusion we are free to believe whatever we want, but it does not make it real. 
We have the power to make the world and believe in it. 
The Course teaches us that what we want in the world is painful, and the peace and love we truly want is of God. (Wingate)

  4. This is a course in mind training.
  ²All learning involves attention and study at some level.
  ³Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their careful study.
  ⁴You will also need them for preparation.
  ⁵Without this, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of it.
  ⁶However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of the implications that will be amplified later on.

    (1) The miracle changes the misperceptions in our wrong mind, which reflects the purpose of <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. (Wapnick, AVI, p.119.)
  </p>

  <p>
    (1) …the text …explains this paradoxical situation to us of being “at home in God, [yet] dreaming of exile” (<a href="/text/10-the-idols-of-sickness/i-at-home-in-god#p2">T-10.I.2:1</a>): how this insane belief in separation seemd to arise in our <em>minds</em>, how it is maintained in our <em>minds</em>, and how it finally is undone in our <em>minds</em>. <em>A Course in Miracles</em> is thus … a “mind training” curriculum designed to help us change our thought system from the ego’s to the Holy Spirit’s. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.13.)
  </p>

  <p>
    (1–6) It is important to read and study the Course, especially the fundamental concepts … presented in the early chapters. 
    The fundamental concepts must be studied, understood and applied in your daily life so they become
    experiential. 
    “This is not a Course in the play of ideas, but in their practical application”. (Wingate)
  </p>

  <p>
    (4–5) …this gentle though firm rebuke and reminder… (Wapnick, FCTL, p.16.)
  </p>

  <p>
    (4) Students of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> may … argue that understanding its theory is irrelevant, and that study of the text is a waste of time, clearly ignoring this warning. (Wapnick, LDNC, p.610).
  </p>

  <p>
    (4) …many students emphasize the workbook at the expense of the text, rather than viewing each book as a companion to the other. The mistake here … reflects the unconscious error of believing that our ego identification is weak and can be easily discarded, leaving our minds open to recieve — instantaneously and joyously — the Word of God. (Wapnick, FCTL, p.171.)

  5. A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made.
  ²I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals.
  ³However, it was also emphasized that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator.
  ⁴I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it.
  ⁵I am also trying to do the same with yours.
  ⁶I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality.
  ⁷Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself.
  ⁸It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific.
  ⁹Healing is of God in the end.
  ¹⁰The means are being carefully explained to you.
  ¹¹Revelation may occasionally reveal the end to you, but to reach it the means are needed.

  (para 4–5) In the last two paragraphs of the first chapter of the text, we read of the need to go very slowly and carefully through all of the material, including the first four chapters. If we do not, we will not be prepared for what will come later, and we will become afraid of it. (Wapnick, A.T.G., p.107.)
